# Author: Bashir Satoro


    print("As the sun goes down, Milo and his dog Bruno decided to go deep into the forest to hunt.")
    print("On their way to the forest, Milo started singing to cheer up his dog for their hunting adventure.")
    print("Milo saw a big deer and slowly took out his hunting gun to shoot it. Unfortunately, due to his bad eyesight, he missed the deer, and it ran away because of the firing sound.")
    print("Bruno was energized by the speed of the deer and chased it all the way to the river, where it was stuck because of the crocodiles.")
    print("Milo quickly took out his gun again as the deer was running, being chased by Bruno, and he shot the deer close to the neck. This time, he made a perfect shot, despite the range, and they took the deer home for a feast.")
